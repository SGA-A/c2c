## Installation
Not supported currently because of the evolving database schema. This will be made when the schema is made final, ie., all the incomplete issues in the `Projects` tab in this repo are implemented (roughly around 2030).

We are not responsible for any errors that may occur when running this bot on your own. It is also **not** production-ready.

## Features
- 💰 Economy system we are continuously working on.
- ⚙️ Useful feature set to gain insight on
- ⚔️ Advanced role management
- 🔉 Temporary voice channel management to reduce eyestrain
- 🏷️ Tagging text by storing it for later retrieval

> [!NOTE]
> The future of this project is uncertain. Given my limited free time, I may not be able to update the code after breaking changes to the library/API take place. This will only dwindle in the future, until 2029 when I return from university.
