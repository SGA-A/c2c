# Contributing

Thanks for considering contributing to our project. We appreciate your time and effort.

For a better experience, we suggest you read through these guidelines. Remember, these are guidelines, not hard rules.

## Bug Reports

### Check for Duplicates
Before submitting a new bug report, check if someone else has already reported the issue.
   
### Provide Details
Clearly describe the bug, including steps to reproduce it and any error messages received.

### Installation
If the bug is related to installation or your environment, you're better off reporting the issue elsewhere. I cannot help with these.

## Pull Requests

### Fork the Repository
Fork the repository to your GitHub account and create a branch for your changes.

### Keep Changes Focused
Each PR should address a single concern. If you have multiple changes, submit them as separate PRs.

### Provide Clear Descriptions
Clearly explain the purpose of your changes in the PR description, including any relevant context.

### Test Your Changes
Ensure that your changes do not introduce new issues and that existing functionality still works.

## Questions and Discussions

You should not make any general discussions or queries within this repository. Instead, join our server.

By contributing to this project, you agree to abide by these guidelines.

Thanks!
