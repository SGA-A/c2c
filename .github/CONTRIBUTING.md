# Contributing

Thanks for considering contributing to our project. We appreciate your time and effort. For a smooth collaboration, read through these guidelines.
Remember, these are guidelines, not hard rules.

## Bug Reports

If you encounter a bug or unexpected behavior, please follow these steps:

1. **Check for Duplicates:** Before submitting a new bug report, check if someone else has already reported the issue.
   
2. **Provide Details:** Clearly describe the bug, including steps to reproduce it and any error messages received.

3. **Installation:** If the bug is related to installation or your environment, you're better off reporting the issue elsewhere. I cannot help with these.

## Pull Requests (PRs)

1. **Fork the Repository:** Fork the repository to your GitHub account and create a branch for your changes.

2. **Keep Changes Focused:** Each PR should address a single concern. If you have multiple changes, submit them as separate PRs.

3. **Provide Clear Descriptions:** Clearly explain the purpose of your changes in the PR description, including any relevant context.

4. **Test Your Changes:** Ensure that your changes do not introduce new issues and that existing functionality still works.

## Questions and Discussions
