## Reporting a Vulnerability

Create an issue if you spot a vulnerability, seperating each numbered point by a header.
1. Provide a brief summary of what the vulnerability is
2. Provide the exact file and the specific lines in which the vulnerability was found in.
3. Briefly describe how this poses a vulnerability to you and/or the developers (us).
  
Once you've sent it, we will review the issue and take actionable steps to eliminate the vulnerability.
Your cooperation in the process is necessary. It may help us or help you from breaking a law and/or the ToS.
